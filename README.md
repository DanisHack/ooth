See the [project timeline](https://github.com/nmaro/ooth/projects/2).

## Documentation

Check out the ultimate [ooth documentation wiki](https://github.com/nmaro/ooth/wiki)!

## Staart

If you want to integrate this library with a GUI, you might want to check out the sister project [Staart](https://github.com/nmaro/staart).

## Examples

There are many ways you can use ooth.

### Vanilla JS

A good starting point could be this minimal example. Reading through the two files of client and server code is recommended.

- [minimal](examples/minimal)

Slight variations of the minimal example:

- [minimal-mongo-auth](examples/minimal-mongo-auth) - for mongodb authentication
- [minimal-ssh](examples/minimal-ssh) - for express with ssh

### Vue.js

The same minimal example as Vanilla JS, but using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

- [minimal-vue](examples/minimal-vue)

### With UI and next.js

The most complete example with a starting UI with all the main user account flow is programmed with next.js and can now be found in the [staart project](https://github.com/nmaro/staart)!

### With create-react-app

The following two examples use create-react-app as a client. If you don't want to use cra you can still analyze the server folders and the code parts that use ooth-client independently.

- [standalone](examples/standalone) - ooth runs as a microservice separate from api, auth transfer is done via JWT.
- [integrated](examples/integrated) - ooth runs in same process as api, no need for JWT.
